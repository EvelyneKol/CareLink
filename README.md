This project is about creating a website to help people who have suffered from fires, floods or other natural disasters.
There are three types of users: administrator, volunteer and citizen.

The administrator determines the items to be traded by adding the categories of the items, products and
their quantity. He can also see a map with the current tasks undertaken by volunteers, statistics with donations and requests from citizens, etc.

Registered citizens can make a request based on their needs or a donation by offering products to other citizens' requests.

Volunteers can see the location of current tasks (offers or requests) on a map.
If they undertake an offer, they must transport the goods from the location of the citizen who wants to offer to the base.
If they undertake a request, they must be supplied from the base with the appropriate products and transport them to the location of the citizen who needs them.
